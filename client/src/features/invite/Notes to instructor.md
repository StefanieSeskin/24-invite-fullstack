My mentor helped me get things on the page.  

At this point, I am pretty sure that over the course of 
four more weeks, I'm not going to be able to train my brain to think differently when it comes to this stuff.  Maybe over time and
who knows how much time, but longer than four weeks, for sure.

COUNTER:  
I tried to create a slice called counterNotSlice to tally
"not going" but it
doesn't work... obviously is not the way to do this.

Marissa tried to help me with the json -- pulling what is needed from the json.  I don't understand what she was talking about.  I did look at what Thomas posted in slack.  I get the idea -- pull what you need.
I don't understand why items are "undefined" because the way 
we used to pull information is now different on the page and I
do not understand why things are different because.  In the past,
I pretty much just copied and pasted syntax in order to get 
items from an array sort of understanding why things work, if that makes sense.  So because this is totally different but the same,
I don't get it.

No clue whatsoever how to visually add the guest data to their respective pages, despite rewatching videos.

ADDING AN IMAGE PLACEHOLDER:
Spent 1/2 trying to figure out how to add placeholder image in
React using something from React and gave up.

This is as far as I can get.
