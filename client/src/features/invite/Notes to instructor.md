I'm going to leave notes like this

My mentor helped me.  If you click on the buttons, you will see that the
random user reloads and the server gets both "going", "not going" 

I could not keep him in zoom forever and got stuck on how to set up 
the going/not going pages.  I also noticed that there is no link or way
for the client to view those pages.  I guess the client screwed up by
not asking for that feature.  Now, it's out of scope and they have to pay
for another 4 weeks of development.  :-D
