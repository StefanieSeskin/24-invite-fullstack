I'm going to leave notes like this

My mentor helped me.  If you click on the buttons, you will see that the
random user reloads and the server gets both "going", "not going" 

I could not keep him in zoom forever and got stuck on how to set up 
the going/not going pages.  I also noticed that there is no link or way
for the client to view those pages.  I guess the client screwed up by
not asking for that feature.  Now, it's out of scope and they have to pay
for another 4 weeks of development.  :-D

Also, Marissa tried to help me with the data dump aspect -- just pulling what
is needed from the json and not the entire json.  I don't understand what
she was talking about so I just left this as it is 

Not even attempting the counter.  No clue.  Didn't get it for the shopping cart,
not going to get it here, even after watching the shopping cart video.
